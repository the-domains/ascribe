Sunday I was invited to a French-English service at a Kingdom Hall just outside Papeete, so I went. 

It was an opportunity to further study French as the speaker was translated after each sentence or paragraph; and there were certain to be cute, spiritual-seeking women.

I had attended a similar service in a regional setting during October, and thus did not go seeking enlightenment.

The theme of the day was how parents should interact or deal with their teen-age children. Humility, insight and explanation were the essential elements, with parents being willing to admit their mistakes, inject biblical teachings in conversations with the teen, and give explanations when directing him or her to do this and not do that.

Nothing new, and everything conveyed was supported by a verse from the Bible. I began to feel that the session and church in general was stuck in history -- the past.

Speakers noted, of course, that teens face peer and societal pressures today like never before. Yet, they relied on the Bible and standardized church text that lacked a real-world, contemporary message. And, unfortunately there were no teens -- only adults and several pre-teens -- at the gathering.

Whenever I am in a church setting, listening to a lecture or sermon, the speaker touches on a theme and then God/The Universe begins transmitting to me on that subject just what needs to be said and heard.(Dialogues in New York City by Krishnamurti way back in the 1980s were the only occasion the message was enlightening and needed no personal or divine intervention.) The speaker, inevitably, does not go there although a few approach the precipice. They are just unwilling to step out on faith and go beyond the Bible or religious dogma.

Churches across the board are stuck in time, and listless, primarily because they relegate God, or the Supreme Being, to a mere book. A book that even a cursory look at history will show is very flawed, compiled by figures of questionable repute and cannot actually be "the word of God." 

The church would have you believe God cannot speak for him/her/itself - as if God is dead and in dying left behind a book and said, "Hear, read this."

The biblical image of a shepherd and sheep is illustrative of how churches see the world. It is said God had an "only begotten son" Jesus, and that he came to earth to be an example of what we, who also are called children of God, should be.

Jesus is said to have said, "Whatever I do, you can do, and more."

The church minimizes such expressions and instead treat truth-seekers as sheep with it as the shepherd and the Bible its staff to keep us in line and essentially docile.

I felt pacification in the air, as every issue was referred to the Bible with the effective message being pray and believe, be a "good" individual and wait on God.

And I was reminded of Sunday School, although this was an adult setting -- as speakers asked elementary questions and listeners gave formulaic answers. 

I left the setting occasionally to re-enter the real world -- to Aleepo, centre-ville Papeete and the streets of North America, Europe, Africa and Asia. I thought , "Now, I would actually join a church that does more than merely instruct how we should behave in our individual petty lives or as families without directly addressing the lives and families living in the strife or war, poverty (just down the street) and natural disasters the world over.

The thought came why cannot churches, instead of using tithing to build idolatry edifices, charter a plane to Damascus and go to the frontlines and illustrate the abomination of war and as human shields stopping it in its tracks.

If only a fraction of the churches, the mosques, the temples that exist do this, the war would end immediately. We could force the state and rebel forces to stop destroying Syria, and the United States, Russia, France and the United Kingdom from decimating it with bombs, spawning countless refugees.

With such coordinated mass action, religious institutions could force governments to finally confront and eliminate poverty. They could effect more humane governmental and corporate practices to end wealth inequality and the fascism gripping the world as the distinction between to two arenas has been erased.

As it is the church and religious institutions generally are the greatest purveyor of the status quo. Nothing has changed in the centuries since Europe began dominating the world through the Bible, the bottle, disease and the gun.
