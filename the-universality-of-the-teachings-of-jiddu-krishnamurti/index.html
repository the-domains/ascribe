We Africans will fight, if necessary, and we know that we shall win, as we are confident in the victory of good over evil. (In his musical rendition of speech excerpts, Bob Marley would add: War in the east /War in the west /War up north/War down south/War/War/Rumors of war/Everywhere is war.) …And we must look into ourselves, into the depth of our souls. We must become something we have never been and for which our education and experience and environment have ill-prepared us. We must become bigger than we have been -- more courageous, greater in spirit, larger in outlook. We must become members of a new race, overcoming petty prejudice, owing our ultimate allegiance not to nations but to our fellow men within the human community .- Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie before the United Nations in October 1963</p><p> In the preface of "Facing A World In Crisis," a 2005 book-publication of teachings by Jiddu Krishnamurti, editor David Skitt wrote: Throughout the 1970s J. Krishnamurti, who had been talking to audiences around the world for more than fifty years, began to speak repeatedly about looking at the state of the world as a first step in looking at the way each of us lives his or her life. To turn away from world events, to think that "what's going on out there has nothing to do with me," was for him not to be alive to what life has to teach, a fake retreat from the vast arena of human behavior where all of us are actors, where we like it or not. To recoil from the world's violence and set ourselves apart -- something we do not do, of course, with life's pleasures -- was a serious misperception, a failure to see and to feel in our blood that "we are all in the same boat." This error, he maintained, would inevitably lead to ineffectual action and conflict. Skitt noted Krishnamurti was not alone is espousing such a philosophy. This view, often expressed by Krishnamurti in the phrase "I am the world," has been stated by others. The philosopher Thomas Hobbes wrote, "Whosoever looks into himself shall know the thoughts and passions of all other men," and Montaigne said, "Every man carries in him the whole of the human condition."</p><p> Philosophers and literary figures whose works often are categorized with Krishnamurti's teachings are: Erich Fromm, Osho, Ram Dass, Thich Nhat Hanh, G.I. Gurdjieff, D.T. Suzuki, Alan W. Watts, P.D. Ouspensky, Ramana Maharshi, Nisargadatta Maharaj and Liu Yiming. Aldous Huxley, the Dalai Lama, Indira Gandhi, Joseph Campbell, Thomas Merton, Deepak Chopra, Bruce Lee, Greta Garbo, Eckart Tolle, Henry Miller are among familiar figures said to have been influenced by the words of Krishnamurti.</p><p> Miller, writing on Krishnamurti in "The Books In My Life," stated: “Men are reluctant to accept what is easy to grasp. Out of a perversity deeper than all Satan’s wiles, man refuses to acknowledge his own God-given rights: he demands deliverance or salvation by and through an intermediary; he seeks guides, counselors, leaders, systems, rituals. He looks for solutions which are in his own breast. He puts learning above wisdom, power above the art of discrimination. But above all, he refuses to work for his own liberation, pretending that first “the world” must be liberated. Yet, as Krishnamurti has pointed out time and again, the world problem is bound up with the problem of the individual. Truth is ever present, Eternity is here and now. And salvation? What is it, O man, that you wish to save? Your petty ego? Your soul? Your identity? Lose it and you will find yourself. Do not worry about God—God knows how to take care of Himself. Cultivate your doubts, embrace every kind of experience, keep on desiring, strive neither to forget nor to remember, but assimilate and integrate what you have experienced.</p><p> Some (a room at the retreat here bears his name) suggest the teachings were an inspiration for John Lennon's "Imagine:" Imagine there's no heaven/It's easy if you try/No hell below us/Above us only sky/Imagine all the people living for today/Imagine there's no countries/It isn't hard to do/Nothing to kill or die for/And no religion too/Imagine all the people living life in peace/you may say I'm a dreamer/But I'm not the only one/I hope some day you'll join us/And the world will be as one/Imagine no possessions/I wonder if you can/No need for greed or hunger/A brotherhood of man/Imagine all the people sharing all the world/You may say I'm a dreamer/But I'm not the only one/I hope some day you'll join us/And the world will be as one.</p><p> James Baldwin, a latter 20th-Century literary giant and Lennon contemporary wrote of the artist in America: This continent now is conquered, but our habits and our fears remain. And, in the same way that to become a social human being one modifies and suppresses and, ultimately, without great courage, lies to oneself about all one’s interior, uncharted chaos, so have we, as a nation, modified or suppressed and lied about all the darker forces in our history. We know, in the case of the person, that whoever cannot tell himself the truth about his past is trapped in it, is immobilized in the prison of his undiscovered self. This is also true of nations. We know how a person, in such a paralysis, is unable to assess either his weaknesses or his strengths, and how frequently indeed he mistakes the one for the other. And this, I think, we do. We are the strongest nation in the Western world, but this is not for the reasons that we think. It is because we have an opportunity that no other nation has in moving beyond the Old World concepts of race and class and caste, to create, finally, what we must have had in mind when we first began speaking of the New World. But the price of this is a long look backward when we came and an unflinching assessment of the record. For an artist, the record of that journey is most clearly revealed in the personalities of the people the journey produced. Societies never know it, but the war of an artist with his society is a lover’s war, and he does, at his best, what lovers do, which is to reveal the beloved to himself and, with that revelation, to make freedom real.</p><p> Scott H. Forbes, in 1994, wrote, "For most of Krishnamurti's life what he said and wrote sparked both interest and controversy. His observations on religion, organizations, tradition, nationalism, and relationships often ran counter to the convention of the day. If they are less startling today, it is either due to the effect his insights have had on common consciousness or an indication of the extent to which he was ahead of his time. The core of Krishnamurti's teaching is contained in the statement he made in 1929 when he said 'Truth is a pathless land'. Man cannot come to it through any organisation, through any creed, through any dogma, priest or ritual, not through any philosophical knowledge or psychological technique. He has to find it through the mirror of relationship, through the understanding of the contents of his own mind, through observation and not through intellectual analysis or introspective dissection.</p><p> Osho, the mystic who said Krishnamurti was too serious and was able to touch people's minds but not their hearts, stated during an interview that "just three days before J. Krishnamurti died, one of my friends was with him; and he reported to me that his words to him were very strange. Krishnamurti was very sad and he simply said one thing: “I have wasted my life. People were listening to me as if I am an entertainment.” There is another local/international icon who let it be no secret that he sought to change the world, who also lamented the limitations of being perceived solely as an entertainer -- or feeling that he was viewed only as such.</p><p> It is no stretch to reason that inarguably the world's best-known figure, now a legendary artist of song and dance an author who spent much of his life surrounding Ojai -- a family home in Encino, the fantasy-made-real Neverland Ranch in Los Olivos, doctors in Santa Paula and at least one night visit to the public library a scant four miles from this campus -- found his way to the teachings of local resident Krishnamurti.</p><p> "We are the world/We are the children/We are the ones who make a brighter day/So let's start giving…" Those words, penned by Jackson with a little help from pop singer Lionel Richie, reflect a major aspect of the teachings of Krishnamurti.</p><p>
 
The teachings are profuse in the body of work left by Jackson, more so than perhaps any other artist, author or public figure past or present.
 
 The lyrics, poems and lectures, the teachings, if you will of Michael Jackson, follow a parallel with those of Krishnamurti much as their two lives do.</p><p> Both were "discovered at a young age and removed from a normal childhood. They went, literally, from rags to riches, with everyday responsibilities and life-altering decisions left to others. Both men grew to feel encumbered by their brand of organized religion, and broke away for greater expression and universality.</p><p>Like Krishnamurti, Michael drew the ire of organized religion, particularly is fundamental strain. Of Another Part of Me (see lyrics below), Joseph Schimmel in 1988 wrote, "This song parallels the New Age Harmonic convergence claim that our planet was finding its rightful alignment in the "galactic community" and summoning the New Age. Jackson performs this song, in a short movie played at Disneyland where he is seen as a savior transforming a decadent society into a paradise with his magic power. This is not to be taken lightly in that his message is drummed into the hearts and minds of millions via his music and as early as 1984 it was being reported that a group had emerged claiming he is the "Messiah returned" and the "Archangel Michael." If we as discerning Christians reject sitting under the teachings of other false teachers, it is my prayer to God that all would reject the musical ministry of Michael Jackson."</p><p> The two figures were hounded by the press, found normal friendships fleeting and came to rely on maternal celebrity/society figures for love and support. Controversy, scandal, conflict and criticism found their way to both men late in their careers.</p><p>As Mary Luytens staunchly defended Krishnamurti against charges in the book "Life in the Shadows," many fans and several journalists presented evidence of Jackson's innocence, particularly following a sensational trial in which he was acquitted.</p><p>Let's go right to the point, which gets lost in our media-driven consciousness, that Jackson was found innocent in the court of law on both charges of child molestation. (Allegations that hounded C.W. Leadbeatter, the Theosophy figure who "discovered Krishnamurti.</p><p> We all remember where we were … when we got the news that Michael Jackson had died, killed by a fatal dose of some obscure hospital-grade anesthetic the singer used to cope with his chronic insomnia. Yet for all the global outpouring of nostalgia and affection, none of us really knew the man we were grieving for. To the general public, especially in his later years, Jackson had become an abstraction, not a person at all but a tabloid cartoon: “Wacko Jacko.” All the hastily written obituaries tied themselves in knots trying to extract a tasteful remembrance from a media narrative that had devolved into constant speculation about his plastic surgery, gossip about his eccentric behavior, and, unavoidably, the did-he-or-didn’t-he allegations of child abuse that engulfed and finally destroyed his reputation. Every gushing bit of praise came with an asterisk firmly affixed. At best, we mourned the precocious, youthful, still-brown boy who’d become such a tragic, broken man. We didn’t mourn the man. When it comes to Jackson’s story today, we’re still doing our best to compartmentalize. We put “Billie Jean” and “Thriller” in one box and put his personal life in another box and try our best not to think about it too much. You have to excavate the human being from the mythology and misinformation built up over the decades. Empathy is the tool required above all others, and empathy is the quality that’s missing from virtually everything ever written about Michael Jackson. We glorify him or we vilify him or we pity him or we take his changing appearance and we use it as fodder for theories about race and gender—the highbrow equivalent of the objectification you’ll find in the tabloids. We do all of this, but we do not attempt to understand him. The idea of Michael Jackson as a human being remains a radical notion. But during the process of writing the book, that is how I came to know him. The eccentric behavior was still eccentric, of course, but seeing it in context, a lot of it actually made sense; I gained a better understanding of why he made the choices he made. As for the allegations of abuse, once I really started digging into them, what surprised me was not just that the allegations are unfounded, but that they are so obviously unfounded. The first claim, made against him in 1993, was debunked by a thorough piece of investigative reporting in GQ. The second claim, made a decade later, was soundly rejected by 12 reasonable jurors as being without merit. These facts are available to anyone with five minutes and an Internet connection. Yet the questions about his innocence persist. The “Wacko Jacko” stories haven’t gone away. The reason they haven’t is because Jackson was different. His actions were outside the norm. People need a context, a framework, in which to understand him. Humans are storytellers. It is our nature to shape facts into a narrative. Jackson’s narrative, driven by the tabloids and adopted by nearly everyone, was that of a boy genius who morphed into a weirdo and a freak and possibly a criminal. That’s the only story we know, and to date no satisfactory counternarrative has emerged to replace it. The allegations against him have long been proved false, but they haven’t been replaced by a more compelling truth. And that’s the problem. Absent a new truth, people remain free to say whatever they want about him. Depending on what day of the week it is, Jackson is either a serial pedophile or a virginal man-child—or, somehow, both. Michael Jackson deserves a more honest accounting of his life. He deserves to have his story told properly. Michael Jackson was, among other things, a smart and voracious reader. He’d take midnight trips to Barnes & Noble and drop $5,000 on books in a single spree. History, art, science, religion, philosophy—he’d sit alone in his house devouring everything he could get his hands on. (If you were a chronic insomniac too famous to leave your own house, you’d read a lot, too.) And the source of Jackson’s Peter Pan obsession was not just Disney’s 1953 animated film, but also J.M. Barrie’s original play and book, vintage editions of which Jackson collected for his library. In Barrie’s original telling, Peter Pan is a very different creature. Unable to grow up, he is trapped in an eternal present. He lives without consequence. He has no memory, and therefore no understanding of how his actions affect others, meaning he can never truly connect or empathize with anyone. He is alone. It’s no accident that Pan’s home, Neverland, is an island cut off from reality. Taken at its most literal, Neverland is a place where you can never land, never rest. It is the same frenetic, make-believe battle of pirates and Indians played out over and over again. When Michael Jackson told us that he was Peter Pan, I don’t think he was telling us that he wanted to be a cartoon. The tragedy of the false allegations against him is that they obscured the very real problems we should have been paying attention to. During his trial, a stream of witnesses testified that Jackson had never done anything inappropriate to them. That they were just friends. I would argue that Jackson’s relationships with children, far from being scandalous, are actually quite boring. Unusual at first glance, yes, but ultimately nothing more than movie nights and trips to amusement parks and other mundane goings-on. Jackson’s relationships with children are more notable for what they tell us about his relationships with adults, or the lack thereof. That’s what’s truly interesting about the man. Jackson bears some responsibility for his own isolation. As a result of a lifetime of being used, he himself was incapable of the kind of reciprocal sharing and trust that meaningful relationships necessarily entail. The man bemoaned his solitude in song after song, yet he was notorious for icing the very relationships he desperately wanted. Jackson could be unfailingly kind and generous to people, but that ostensible sweetness masked a deeper inability to relate. He’d grown up as the center of his own universe, in a world where everyone catered to him. When relationships grew messy or demanding, he would just shut them down. By the time he moved to Vegas, Jackson had distanced himself from all of his famous siblings. (Yes, even Janet.) Jackson’s two marriages, to Lisa Marie Presley and Debbie Rowe, are also good examples. Like everything else in Jackson’s life, those relationships were the subject of endless and generally tasteless speculation. But we needn’t speculate about the nature of the marriages to note the one obvious thing about them: They didn’t last very long. Even if they were the arrangements people alleged them to be, they weren’t even successful on that level. Maybe the guy on TV calling himself Peter Pan wasn’t the crazy one. Jackson took refuge in the world of children because it was the only place he felt safe. Children, he often said, “don’t want anything from you.” In fact, outside of the recording studio, only three relationships served as constants in Jackson’s world: his relationship with his mother, his relationship with his fans, and his relationship with children. These relationships all share one thing in common: They’re easy. A mother’s love is unconditional. The devotion of a fan, even more so. And who among us is immune to the wide-eyed adoration of a child? These types of love, though a joy to receive, require little effort. They don’t challenge the recipient. And eventually, they become debilitating. Too much mothering and too much hero-worship stranded Jackson right where he was, left him unwilling and unable to change. It’s admirable that Jackson’s hard-core fans never rushed to judge him the way the general public did, but the adoration of fans and children alone cannot fill the role of a spouse or a partner or true friend. Those are the relationships that force us to be our best selves. Ecstasies innumerable, yet denied the simple joys of being human. Seems a pretty astute description of life inside Jackson’s gilded cage. Maybe the guy on TV calling himself Peter Pan wasn’t the crazy one. The biggest difference I can see between Michael Jackson and Peter Pan was that Pan had no memory of what caused the nightmares that afflicted him. Jackson knew all too well why he couldn’t sleep at night, which is why he looked to the syringe and the pill bottle to try and make it to morning. Michael Jackson made a lot of unhealthy choices in an effort to cope with the burdens he carried, but we shouldn’t judge those choices without a diligent and sincere effort to understand why he made them. Last year the late King of Pop topped Forbes’ list of highest-earning celebrities, easily besting his closest living competitor, Madonna, by a good $35 million. That feat was made possible by a massive overhaul of his debt-ridden estate, which has been transformed into a wildly profitable, billion-dollar enterprise. If that much effort can be made to refurbish his professional legacy, it would be a crime if we did any less for his personal one. Michael Jackson ought to have his story reconsidered. The man led an extraordinary and extraordinarily difficult life. He deserves an epitaph that doesn’t have an asterisk next to it.</p><p> Neither was stranger to criticism and comparisons: Blavatsky's Prophecy and Krishnamurti Jun 20, 1996 02:54 PM by alexis dolgorukii: A message with this title has appeared both on "theos-list" and "alt.theosophy" several times lately so I would assume everyone who is interested in the subject has read it and I shan't re-print it. With all due respect and affection for Mr. Ramadoss. It is clear to me (at least) that his enormous affection and admiration of Krishnamurti has blinded him completely and he hasn't allowed reality to intrude on his enthusiasms. There is simply no possible way in which Mr. Krishnamurti, no matter how one may view him, can be seen to fulfill Blavatsky's prophesies. Blavatsky feared greatly, and also prophesied, that The Theosophical Society would take a "wrong turn" and become a religion (which it has) and therefore "fade away" (which it is in the process of doing) while theosophy would continue to go on forever, as it had forever existed. She said that in any case the "Great White Brotherhood" would send a new messenger after 1975 in the "last quarter of the 20th century". That hardly fits Krishnamurti in any way. His prime notoriety was in the first quarter of the 20th century. By the time 1975 rolled around his life was drawing to a close. Mr. Ramadoss comments that Blavatsky had said that the messenger would, if the society didn't "self-destruct" find an organization "ready and waiting to serve him". But as Dr Alan Bain so clearly pointed out: "Krishnamurti walked out on that organization" to which I'd like to add that Krishnamurti missed no opportunity for the rest of his life to repudiate theosophy. The place where Mr. Ramadoss goes furthest from reality is in assuming a world-wide notoriety and fame for Krishnamurti which just never existed. One of the great problems with small, closed, incestuous societies, of which Theosophy is a good example, is that, because they generally only communicate with one another, the members of that closed group make the entirely false assumption that "everyone" thinks as they do. This is equally true of all fundamentalist groups. It's why the religious "right" in the USA is always being surprised by it's relative lack of power. It's why the people in the "Patriot" and "Militia" movements are always so astonished to find that most of their fellow-citizens think they're insane. It's really important to realize that, just as most people have never heard of Theosophy, even fewer people have ever heard of Krishnamurti. It's probably safe to say that for every million people who have heard of Michael Jackson there is one whose heard of Krishnamurti. And for every one that has heard of Krishnamurti, it must also be acknowledged that very few of them feel towards Krishnamurti the way Mr. Ramadoss does. Most people found Krishnamurti rude, arrogant, boring, evasive, dogmatic and uncaring. As a scholar I have never found anything particularly important in Mr. Rajagopal's editions of his speeches which are actually all the greatest majority of his published works seem to be. No, I don't think Krishnamurti was the "World Teacher", nor did he give any indications of fitting any rational definition of "Adept hood". I respect, like, and admire Mr. Ramadoss, but i am afraid that Jiddu Krishnamurti was no Messiah.</p><p> Michael Jackson, like Krishnamurti, had a love for the innocence and playfulness and godliness of children. They spoke out as advocates for children, Krishnamurti in terms of education and Jackson on a host of issues from child labor to human trafficking to societal pressures that tend to negate childhood. "I would like to welcome you to Carnegie Hall, the world's most famous concert hall to hear an entirely different kind of music, a loftier melody. It's a more eternal song. There are two kinds of music. One comes from the strings of a guitar, the other from the strings of the heart. One sound comes from a chamber orchestra, the other from the beating of the heart's chamber. One comes from an instrument of graphite and wood, the other from an organ of flesh and blood. This loftier music I speak of tonight is more pleasing than the notes of the most gifted composers, more moving than a marching band, more harmonious than a thousand voices joined in hymn and more powerful than all the world's percussive instruments combined. That sweet sound of love. Just a generation ago, it was this sound that could be heard in every turn in every town. It was the sound of love that echoed in the living room when a father giggled with his son or a mother tickled a small infant child. It was the sound of love that echoed from children's literary classics as the parents read children dreamy tales before they went to bed. And it was the sound of love that reverberated in their dinner conversations. Between parents and children, not just once a year over turkey and stuffing but every day for peace and prosper. Sadly, that sound has become a lost melody, a forgotten refrain, an empty tune and all we have in its place today is a dark and terrible noise. Instead of dinner conversations, there is the noise of video games. Instead of homework there is the din of the evening news. And instead of regular conversations between parents and children about drugs and violence, there is the deafening sound of silence. Who among us would have believed that the sound of children at their playgrounds would be replaced by the sound of automatic machine-gun fire at our schools? That the sound of little girls skipping rope would be overshadowed by the frantic squeals of children dodging bullets? Yet, instead of loving our children more, we install metal detectors in our schools. Are we blind to the fact that our children are raging against the indifference, crying out against the abandonment or thundering against the neglect? 'Heal The Kids' is about doing something, about making a difference and trying to help adults and parents realize that it's in our power to change the world that our children live in. As a wise man once said, "If not us, then who; if not now, when?"</p><p> Nature was another source of love for both men, whether mountainside walks or observing birds and animals. Jackson sung about this love of nature, and opposed its decimation, in Earth Song; and wrote about it in Planet Earth. He was active in rescuing abused or neglected animals, and a farm sanctuary was established at his Neverland Ranch.

There is plenty Beethoven, and Jackson shared a love for that composer. Krishnamurti died in 1987, when Jackson was at the zenith of his planetary popularity. It is very likely one knew of the other; that they were familiar with each other's message.</p><p>In 1993 Jackson released "Will You Be There," which he wrote while sitting in a tree at his Neverland Ranch. The full version of the song includes a prelude featuring the Cleveland Orchestra and the Cleveland Orchestra Chorus performing a portion of Beethoven's ninth symphony. The segment is from the fourth movement and is a lesser known portion of the famous "Ode to Joy". The German lyrics were written by Friedrich Schiller. German original[6] English translation Ihr stürzt nieder, Millionen? Ahnest du den Schöpfer, Welt? Such' ihn über'm Sternenzelt! Über Sternen muss er wohnen. Do you bow down, millions? Do you sense the Creator, world? Seek Him beyond the starry canopy! Beyond the stars must He dwell.</p><p> Both figures allowed for a public persona of celibacy, or asexuality, while maintaining secret relationships with women in which they engaged in sexual intercourse. Lutyens, in defending Krishnamurti and all but acknowledging she was one of his lovers during their adolescence, noted he never claimed to be celibate and had decried the practice. She wrote that he stated the following in response to a questioner: So-called holy men have maintained that you cannot come near God if you indulge in sex, therefore they push it aside although they are eaten up with it. But by denying sexuality they put out their eyes and cut out their tongues for they deny the whole beauty of the earth. They have starved their hearts and minds; they are dehydrated human beings; they have banished beauty because beauty is associated with woman. • I think we should understand what love and chastity are. The vow of chastity is not chastity at all, for below the words the cravings goes on and trying to suppress it in different ways, religion and otherwise, is a form of ugliness which, in its very essence, is unchaste. The chastity of the monk, with his vows and denials, is essentially worldliness which is unchaste. All forms of resistance build a wall of separation which turns life into a battlefield; and so life becomes not chaste at all. To deny sex is another form of brutality; it is there, it is a fact. When we are intellectual slaves, endlessly repeating what others have said, when we are following, obeying, imitating, then a whole avenue of life is closed; when action is merely mechanical repetition and not a free movement, then there is no release; when there is an incessant urge to fulfill, to be, then we are emotionally thwarted, there is a blockage. So sex becomes the one issue which is our very own, which is not second-hand. And in the act of sex there is a forgetting of oneself , one's problems and one's fears. In that act there is no self at all. - Can't you fall in love and not have a possessive relationship? I love someone and she loves me, and we get married -- that is all perfectly straightforward and simple, in that here is no conflict at all. Can't one have that without the other? Without the tail, as it were, necessarily following? Can two people be in love and both be so intelligent and so sensitive that there is freedom and an absence of a centre that makes conflict? Conflict is not in the feeling of being in love. The feeling of being in love is utterly without conflict. Three is no loss of energy in being in love. The loss of energy is in the tail -- jealousy, possessiveness, suspicion, doubt, the fear of losing that love, the constant demand for reassurance and security. Surely it must be possible to function in a sexual relationship with someone you love without the nightmare which usually follows. Of course it is. - You have to find out for yourself. Sex plays an extraordinary important part in our lives because it is perhaps the only deep, first-hand experience we have. Intellectually and emotionally we conform, imitate, follow, obey. There is pain and strife in all our relationships, except in the act of sex. This act, being so different and beautiful, we become addicted to, so it in turns become bondage. The bondage is the demand for its continuation -- again the action of the centre which is divisive. One is so hedged about -- intellectually, in the family, in the community, through social morality, through religious sanctions -- so hedged about that there is only this one relationship left in which there is freedom and intensity. Therefore we give tremendous importance to it. But if there were freedom all around then this would not be such a craving and such a problem. We make it a problem because we can't get enough of it; or because we feel guilty at having got it, or because in getting it we break the rules which society had laid down. It is the old society which calls the new society permissive because for the new society sex is a part of life. In freeing the mind from the bondage of imitation, authority, conformity and religious prescriptions, sex has its own place, but it won't be all-consuming. From this one can see that freedom is essential for love -- not the freedom of revolt, not the freedom of doing what none likes or not indulging openly or secretly one's cravings, but rather the freedom which comes in the understanding of this whole structure and nature of the centre. The freedom is love. "I'm sorry you feel that way about what I say. The ecstasy that I feel is the outcome of this world. I wanted to understand, I wanted to conquer sorrow, this pain and detachment, and attachment, death, continuity of life, everything that man goes through every day. I wanted to understand, I wanted to conquer sorrow, this pain of detachment & attachment, death, continuity of life, everything that man goes through every day. I want to understand and conquer it. I have. So my ecstasy is real & infinite, not an escape. I know that way out of this incessant misery, and I want to help people out of the bog of this sorrow. No, this is not an escape.</p><p> Both died with regrets, but with incredible bodies of work for the world to utilize in making the change they sought.</p><p> Back in the late 1970s, I had the rare chance of meeting philosopher J. Krishnamurti (1895-1986). He suffered from a similar frustration too. Later, in a documentary made on his life, those who were close to him during his last days discussed his frustration. Both, philosopher J. Krishnamurti and artist Michael Jackson spoke of change, of the ultimate freedom from bondage, from the old-rotten old paradigms. And, as rightly put by Mahatma Gandhi, both realized the necessity of "being the change" that they wanted to see in the world. Yet, both of them died frustrated, as did the Mahatma. Gandhi who could not accept the idea of India's division based on religion. J. Krishnamurti let out his frustrations through his writings and discussions with people around him. Gandhi let out his frustrations by withdrawing from political life and going back to his commune in Gujaratm. Michael Jackson, the star, may have let out his frustrations by experimenting with his body, From strict diets, plastic surgery and his involvement in unpopular ventures, his love and sex lives can all be seen as manifestations of his innermost desire to change. Change was both, his dream and his obsession. When he "felt" that he failed to bring about change, or at least it was not the kind of change he desired, he withdrew and shut himself away from the outer world. This was a grave mistake. By doing so, he closed the outlets to let go of his frustrations. and died a lonely man. Yet, a man, a star like Michael Jackson is too big to die. Indeed, he is too bright a star to fall. He shall shine for many, many years. His legacy of songs, his unfulfilled dream of the world to come, and his obsession to change shall be remembered by generations to come. Michael's dream shall remain alive, for his dream is not a loner's dream, his dream is the dream of all those who are capable of dreaming something big. Jackson, we share your frustration and we will turn this into a source of energy to realize your dream, to "make a better world for you and for me". I shall not bid you good-bye my friend, for in your dream our meeting continues… A friend-turned author</p><p> MICHAEL JACKSON'S MESSAGE SAMPLES</p><p> I'm starting with the man in the mirror/I'm asking him to change his ways/And no message could have been any clearer/If you want to make the world a better place Take a look at yourself and then make that/Change!

That is why you must read, that is why you must look at the skies, that is why you must sing, and dance, and write poems, and suffer, and understand, for all that is life.</p><p> Michael Jackson certainly did and experienced that all.</p><p>In a June 2009 news feature article titled "Michael Jackson, the Bookworm" (I contacted the first store mentioned in the article, and it is now out of business. A woman who answered the phone at Book Soup said she was there when Jackson came into the store. She did not remember him purchasing works of Krishnamurti -- only hippopotamus, child labor abuse in England and a spiritual figure whose name she could not remember. "He would buy $10,000 worth of books, so it is possible Krishnamurti was somewhere in there," she concluded.) the Los Angeles Times reported: "He was a longtime and valued customer," a store representative of art and architecture bookstore Hennessey + Ingalls said Thursday. "We'll miss him." If Jackson's bookstore appearance surprised his pop fans, it was nothing new for booksellers. A few years ago, Doug Dutton, proprietor of then-popular Dutton's Books in Brentwood, was at a dinner with people from Book Soup, Skylight and other area bookstores. "Someone mentioned that Michael Jackson had been in their store," Dutton said by phone Thursday, "And everybody said he'd shopped in their store too." "He loved the poetry section," Dave Dutton said as Dirk chimed in that Ralph Waldo Emerson was Jackson's favorite. "I think you would find a great deal of the transcendental, all-accepting philosophy in his lyrics." Largely an autodidact, Jackson was quite well read, according to Jackson's longtime lawyer. "We talked about psychology, Freud and Jung, Hawthorne, sociology, black history and sociology dealing with race issues," Bob Sanger told the LA Weekly after the singer's death. "But he was very well read in the classics of psychology and history and literature . . . Freud and Jung -- go down the street and try and find five people who can talk about Freud and Jung." Hours after his death, Jackson's 1988 autobiography, "Moonwalk," despite being out of print, entered the Amazon bestseller list for biography and memoir at No. 25."I've always wondered if there was a library in Neverland," Doug Dutton mused. Indeed there was -- Sanger told LA Weekly that Jackson's collection totaled 10,000 books. And while the seven-bedroom Holmby Hills home that he leased this year had a sunny pool and other luxuries the sunlight-wary Jackson might not have taken advantage of, it also featured something he very well might have: a wood-paneled library."</p><p> In "Dancing the Dream," a book of essays and poems that followed "Moonwalk," Jackson wrote: "Consciousness expresses itself through creation. This world we live in is the dance of the creator. Dancers come and go in the twinkling of an eye but the dance lives on. On many an occasion when I am dancing, I have felt touched by something sacred. In those moments, I felt my spirit soar and become one with everything that exists. I become the stars and the moon. I become the lover and the beloved. I become the victor and the vanquished. I become the master and the slave. I become the singer and the song. I become the knower and the known. I keep on dancing then it is the eternal dance or creation. The creator and creation merge into one wholeness of joy. I keep on dancing...and dancing...and dancing. Until there is only...the dance.”</p><p> Like Krishnamurti, Jackson wrote of a love for nature and its vast beauty -- in animals, mountains and rivers and skies and stars.

It’s beautiful to look at, it’s a minute of joy...Like when I’m 40,000 feet in the air in a Jumbo Jet at night and it’s dawn. Everybody on the plane is asleep, and here I am in the cockpit with the pilots...it’s just incredible seeing a sunrise and being up there with it.

Michael Jackson</p><p> "The meaning of life is contained in every single expression of life. It is present in the infinity of forms and phenomena that exist in all of creation." Michael Jackson</p><p> “When all life is seen as divine, everyone grows wings.” Michael Jackson Like Krishnamurti, Jackson felt the pressures and pulls of organized religion were incongruent with his spiritual consciousness and broke from them. From the beginning it was always a quandary for me, Michael’s birthday. From the first day we met, unfamiliar to me, I was faced with his chosen religion, Jehovah’s Witness. When Michael arrived for his photo shoot for THRILLER, two men accompanied him impeccably dressed in suits, who sat over to the side on some cushy couches and watched his every move. Since this was the first time I worked with him, it didn’t feel appropriate for me to ask who they could possibly be. I thought if he wanted us to know, he would have told us. I just felt their presence throughout the entire day. They left with him as mysteriously as they had entered with him. At the time I really did not give it another thought, because I had no idea of the adventure that was ahead of me. The next shoot, there again…a mysterious gentleman, sitting in the background. As our working relationship and friendship began to grow, I asked. He explained to me he was a Jehovah’s Witness. He was very active with the church, and these gentlemen were monitors. They watched over him. He also explained he went to bible study, and spent time going door-to-door teaching the word each week. I had to take pause for a minute and think about that one…. THRILLER had been released by the time he was explaining this to me. “You mean to tell me, that you ring someone’s doorbell, they come to answer it, and there stands Michael Jackson??????” He gave me one of his hi pitched belly laughs…and said, “yeah”. He further explained that he does it in disguise. “Oh no you don’t.” Still giggling, he paused and got amusingly serious. “Yeah, sure. After they let me in, they usually begin to look at me funny, so I end up admitting who I am.” “Wow, I wish I could be a fly on the wall and watch that. I still can’t believe you do that.” I said. “It is a big part of being a Jehovah’s Witness. We also do not celebrate holidays or birthdays. We believe that we should honor and celebrate these things daily, and not have just one day.” So I asked “No birthdays. No Christmas?” “No” he replied. “Isn’t that difficult, when the world around you is decorating and singing carols?”. “Yes, Turkle…it is always kind of sad, especially when I was a child, because it looked like so much fun. But it is okay; we have things like FAMILY DAY, where we all get together. There are hundreds of Jacksons and we all try and be there.” I could genuinely see the sadness in his eyes and the sense his feeling of loss, not celebrating Christmas with the other kids…so I changed the subject. One August 29th, we ended up working. Everyone was wishing him Happy Birthday and giving him little presents. He smiled and graciously accepted them. Once we were in the privacy of the trailer, he put the gifts down on the seat, and looked down at them. “I wish people wouldn’t do that. Please promise me, Turkle, don’t EVER say Happy Birthday to me.” I was torn. I once again saw how sad and conflicted he was on the inside about this, but he remained loyal to hi s beliefs. It was so difficult for me too. I wanted to give him a present and a big birthday hug every time August 29th rolled around, and join in with the others who were celebrating his birthday around him. I also wanted to comply with his request not to even SAY happy birthday. We were shooting SMOOTH CRIMINAL. I was accustomed to the monitors by now. The filming was going on longer than planned, as usual. We were preparing for a very big scene. Michael was surrounded by the alien battalion in a gully, built on stage 14. The special weapons and ammunition team had briefed Michael on how to hold the machine gun and fire it. It was the last scene of the evening. Michael was having fun with it, like a little boy playing army. He took a strong stance, and fired as the cameras rolled. That was a wrap for that evening, and we were given our call time for the next morning. Michael was a little late arriving the next day. I was waiting in his trailer. He walked in so distraught. I didn’t understand, we were having so much fun the night before. He was silent as he sat in the makeup chair. I had to ask him please tell me. Please tell me what is wrong. His eyes welled up with tears. “Mother called last night. The church called her, and told her that I held and fired a gun yesterday. They ordered that I have to make decision. I must leave the church, or leave the entertainment industry.” He was weeping as he uttered those words. I was quite mortified. “What did your mother advise you to do?” “She felt horrible. She told me it was up to me. She said she would stand by me with whatever I decided.” “I see, you are here today”. “Yes” “Mother is supporting my choice”. -- Karen Faye, make-up artist and friend</p><p> "In every generation, there are a handful of people who come into this world equipped with the ability to change it for the better because of their heightened sense of awareness about the power of love. Those people understand love, not as a feeling, but as a state of being, a way of relating to the world. They have a certain light about them; a way of living that encompasses being kind, caring, compassionate and empathic. Through their ability to connect to love, they have the potential to heal the world. Michael Jackson was one of them. In an attempt to define love, I’ll defer to Marianne Williamson through her book called "A Return to Love." She says, "(Love) is our ultimate reality, and our purpose on earth. To be consciously aware of it, to experience love in ourselves and others, is the meaning of life." Michael seemed to truly understand that concept. His connection to love was so strong that he had an enhanced ability to deeply touch other people with his light. When someone who is that connected to love focuses their attention on you in a positive way, the result is a flow of energy that penetrates your soul and the outcome is a feeling of pure joy. Once that joyful feeling is experienced you want more, so you’re continually drawn back to the source of it, which in the case is Michael. Lisa Marie Presley touched on it in her recent interview with Oprah Winfrey. When she was asked why she fell in love with Michael, she said, "because he was an incredibly dynamic person. If you were in his vicinity and he showed you who he was, if he was willing to do that, in any way, man I’ve never felt so high in my life. He had something so intoxicating about him." Fans know that feeling all too well. We were always the focus of his attention in a positive way, but it was good to hear that those who were close to him felt the same effect. Oprah even let on to the fact that she was taken in by it, "When I first met him before the interview in 1992," Oprah said, "it’s like he shines his light upon you. When he opens himself up and lets that light through, you just want to be in that, you want to be around that." Lisa Marie went on to describe him as her drug. "I felt like I just always wanted to be around him. I always wanted to be part of it. I felt so high. I’ve never felt that way around another human being except for one…which is my father." Michael’s light, which affected millions all over the world, was so powerful that even in death it keeps pulling people back in. It’s been over a year and a half since his passing and the world can’t seem to let him go. (...) Once you have been on the receiving end of his light, it’s hard to let him go. You’re drawn to him forever, because it was through him that you experienced the power of love. (...)" Linda Higgins, 2010</p><p> "He is the most humble, caring, sensitive, caring man you could ever imagine. What you hear about him from much of the media is either speculation or fabrication, but what you hear from those who have met him is absolutely the truth. Most will tell you, he has an aura that radiates warmth, love and tenderness, and most never ever forget such meetings. When meeting or even around Michael, there was certainly an aura. It was quite incredible. And it wasn't just when meeting him, it often continued afterwards too. I distinctly remember after a meeting with him in Tenerife, I just had this tremendous sense of love for everyone. I just wanted to love people. Michael hadn't spoken directly about this to me, but it was almost as if that aura around him had somehow rubbed off on me, if that makes sense? When I went to the US for the Memorial, I just wept on seeing so many notes and cards outside each of places of significance. From the Hollywood Star to Neverland; from Carolwood Drive to the Staples Centre, people from all over the world had come to place their condolences. And what an amazing impact he had on people's lives - every other note seemed to be thanking him for what he had done, how much he had inspired them to live their dreams, how much he had taught them. And, in amongst the notes and cards in every place were crucifixes and references to God. I was on my knees in tears. I had always, always known that this was a man of God, but I had never fully appreciated just how many ordinary lives he had changed. Even those fans who never met Michael often felt a deep connection with him. He had that capacity to draw you close, to mesmerize you with his love and compassion, but also with his aura, which he always acknowledged was from God Almighty Himself." Dee Pffeifer, a friend of Michael and one of the many thousands of people that Michael helped throughout his lifetime</p><p> Jonathan, people speak of an energy around Michael; a light. Did you ever feel that? Jonathan Sugarfoot Moffett: All the time, every time I am around him. That’s why you know you are in the presence of greatness. That’s why you know you’re in the presence of somebody special. Just count the number of fans and people and the multitude that love him around the world. He’s one man loved by... CNN said that over one billion people mourned Michael from all the remote areas of the world, as well as all the known areas. What other human being can draw that much sympathy and that much hurt from their loss. Michael had something special, a radiance, and when you were in his presence the whole room changed. People would say, "Michael’s coming," and everybody got nervous. As soon as you had the vision of him, even just knowing he was coming, you felt something, like a tingle happening. Just to watch him walk through the door, it’s like all the molecules in the air stop and you can pinch them with your finger; pick them up. It’s like you could see the smallest speck; you could see the molecules in the air when Michael walked in the room. He changed them; the molecular structure of the air. And that’s the equation of what happens when Michael enters, and everybody in the room felt it and knew it. Then their attitudes and personalities would change. They would perk up their attention, but they would always say, “There’s something with him. When he came in I got nervous. I felt something!” And I would hear that over and over again and I would say, “I know, I know. I’ve been feeling it for thirty years.” And he was just so pleasant; just something with his imagery. Everybody radiates from a different frequency, and Michael had the highest level of energy I think without being from another world. His gift and his humanity of spirit were just so powerful and great and deep. He was a different human being from most of us; from all of us. He did affect everybody that came around him, from leaders of the world to normal folk, from children to people, grandmothers. Every single person that’s been around him said they felt something, that I remember seeing or talking to. And that’s why people cry. People absolutely cry. I would sit on stage and watch them pass bodies, like back in the medieval days when people died of the plague. You would see them lift bodies, arms dangling and legs, heads swinging, and there was like an ocean of people with their arms up passing bodies to the front, to the gate. There would be a line-up there of emergency vehicles... five, ten of them lined up. There were stretchers and triages back there. One by one, people were passing them forward; sometimes a multitude of bodies moving across the crowd being passed to the rescue people. They would give them smelling salts and try to revive them. Some people were just totally gone, unconscious, you know, like totally no life in them, and that’s just from being in that stadium with Michael. I just got to just sit back there and marvel at it. It was just the most powerful thing to see, and that’s just from that one man in the center of the stage. He made even men pass out; women and men. That’s a power and Michael knew it. He knew he was gifted with something special, a purpose; uniting the world and uniting people.</p><p> Do you know the poem by William Blake - To see a World in a grain of sand, And a Heaven in a wild flower, Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand, And Eternity in an hour . . . The intense ambition of that poem, the intense desire for wonder, was alive in Michael. More alive than anything of the sort I’d ever seen. Michael saw the infinite in an inch. As Michael opened the page further, inch by inch, his knees and elbows bent even more and his ”ooohs,” his sounds of aesthetic orgasm, grew even more intense. Standing elbow to elbow and shoulder to shoulder with him, you could feel him discovering things in the brush and inkstrokes that even the artist never saw. By the time he’d opened the full page his body and voice expressed an ecstasy. An aesthetic epiphany. I’d never encountered anything like it. Michael felt the beauty of the page with every cell of his being. I’ve worked with Prince, Bob Marley, Peter Gabriel, Billy Joel, and Bette Midler, some of the most talented people of our generation, and not one of them had the quality of wonder that came alive in Michael. He saw the wonder in everything. His quality of wonder was beyond anything most of us humans can conceive. Look, above all other things I’m a scientist. Science is my religion. It’s been my religion since I was ten years old. The first two rules of science are 1) the truth at any price including the price of your life; and 2) Look at the things right under your nose as if you’ve never seen them before and then proceed from there. And that’s not just a rule of science. It’s a rule of art. And it’s a rule of life. Very few people know it. Even fewer people live it. But Michael was it, he incarnated it in every follicle of his being. Michael was the closest I’ve ever come to a secular angel. A secular saint. Look, I’m an atheist, but Michael was not. He believed he was given a gift by God. He believed he was given talents and wonders and astonishments seldom granted to us very fragile human beings. Because God had given him this enormous gift, he felt he owed the experience of wonder, astonishment, awe, and Blake’s infinities to his fellow human beings. But unlike other generous humans–Bill and Melinda Gates, for example–with Michael giving to others was not just a part-time thing. The need to give to others was alive in every breath he took every single day. Michael Jackson’s entire life was receiving and giving and the whole purpose of receiving was so he could give. He worked with every cell in his body to give the gift of that amazement, that astonishment to his fellow human beings. Needing the adulation of crowds WAS Michael’s connection to others, his most profound connection, far more profound than family and friends (though those are indispensable), and far more healing. That act of giving keeps an iconic person, a person who never knows normalness, alive. Howard Bloom, an author</p><p> "In Mahavanain Buddhism, there is an enlightened existence known as the ‘bodhisattva’ In this position, a person decides to postpone attainment of nirvana in order to alleviate the suffering of others,” states Treacy. Treacy feels this very much describes the kind of person Michael was. Forgoing his own happiness to help to heal others, and this planet. “I have been fortunate to have met some of these visionaries, Nelson Mandela, Mother Theresa, Bono, John Lennon and Michael Jackson,” stated Treacy. “Only five people in nearly half a century. Just enough to count on the fingers of one hand. Each of them, intrinsically motivated by a sense of great compassion, generating bodhicitta for the ultimate benefit of all sentient beings. I knew Lady Diana Spencer during the mid-nineties in a medical sense and I had been in the presence of His Holiness the Dalai Lama without having actually met him. All of these people, hugely influential, global messengers using their powers to try and make the world a better place for each of us to live in. Nelson Mandela stood against the injustice of apartheid, Mother Theresa and Bono against the injustice of poverty, John Lennon against the injustice of war, but Michael Jackson went further. His body of artistic work carried a spiritual message for these and all of the other injustices of the human race…those of racism, inequality, disease, hunger and corruption. That to me was the embodiment of Michael Jackson the friend.” “All great spiritual leaders went through a period of self-analysis, doubt and meditation. I feel this is part of his real legacy.” Dr. Patrick Treacy</p><p> "One thing is certain.. the whole world is in a different vibe. The fact that millions of humans in most countries around the world, different cultures, religions, skin color.. are sharing the same emotion: Love.. for this man. It's something.. not common in our world civilization. This could be the ONLY time in our species existence.. that we are unified in some way. You saved lives when you were alive, and you're saving lives after you have passed." ZeroWing via You Tube</p><p> “Although Michael comes from a young American tradition he is the rebirth of an old Indian soul. His actions are expressions of the ‘Philosophy Weda’, which calls for working for people not for own interests.” Introduction "Thank you very much. Thank you very much for this honour you’ve awarded me tonight. I have always believed that the real measure of celebrity-success was not just how famous he becomes but what he does with that fame and fortune. Especially in today's technological and media advanced society the attention and fortune shower on an individual celebrity is often times immensely disproportioned to his or her achievements. Today a person can literally become a celebrity overnight throughout the entire world, and that kind of attention can be difficult for an individual to handle. But I have also learned that such fame can also be an enormous effective medium to focus attention and mobilise resources for a worthy cause. I have been blessed with so much and have an opportunity to do what few others can. But I believe it is more than just an opportunity but a duty. I feel to reap and enjoy the fruits of my talents for myself would be selfish, irresponsible and unconscionable. In these days of such abundance and advancement — and what we can do — it pains me to think that we do so little for our children. In some ways I feel undeserving to receive an award for something that is my duty. I accept this award at the gesture of encouraging from the people of India and the commission to do more for mankind. I love you very much. Mahatma Gandhi knew how important bringing the world attention was to gaining freedom for India without using any weapons. In some ways he was the first person to truly understand the importance and power of the public. He has always been an inspiration to me and it gives me even greater joy and pride to be recognized by his people. 1999 Bollywood Awards</p><p> “I had never seen any newspaper clippings, trophies, gold records, or other awards you’d expect to see somewhere in his house. I asked him about this and he smiled, saying, ‘All that stuff’s in a house up on the other side of the property.’ I asked him, ‘Why don’t you put some of it up in here where everyone can see it?’ He answered,’ Well, I don’t like show offs and I don’t want to be one. If I keep those things around me here where everyone can see them, then that kind of thing ends up being the topic of conversation and there are much more interesting things to talk about. I don’t want to be reminded of who I am and what I’ve done and then end up thinking more of myself than is good for me. Because, it’s not me. I mean it’s a gift, what I have…it’s a gift from God. He gave this to me, so it’s really not mine. I get to use it, enjoy it, have fun with it…more important, share it. But, it’s just a loan, really.” - A Friend</p><p> Michael Jackson, Dancing the Dream -- When I step out on stage in front of thousands of people, I don't feel that I'm being brave. It can take much more courage to express true feelings to one person. [...] In spite of the risks, the courage to be honest and intimate opens the way to self-discovery. It offers what we all want, the promise of love. ”</p><p> “A star can never die. It just turns into a smile and melts back into the cosmic music, the dance of life.” “But for me the sweetest contact with God has no form. I close my eyes, look within, and enter a deep soft silence. The infinity of God's creation embraces me.”</p><p> “What we need to learn from children isn't childish. Being with them connects us to the deep wisdom of life, which is ever present and only asks to be lived. Now, when the world is so confused and its problems so complicated, I feel we need our children more than ever. Their natural wisdom points the way to solutions that lie, waiting to be recognized, within our own hearts.” “I'm going to search for my star until I find it. It's hidden in the drawer of innocence, wrapped in a scarf of wonder.”</p><p> “It's easy to mistake being innocent for being simpleminded or naive. We all want to seem sophisticated; we all want to seem street-smart. To be innocent is to be "out of it." Yet there is a deep truth in innocence. A baby looks in his mother's eyes, and all he sees is love. As innocence fades away, more complicated things take its place. We think we need to outwit others and scheme to get what we want. We begin to spend a lot of energy protecting ourselves. Then life turns into a struggle. People have no choice but to be street-smart. How else can they survive? When you get right down to it, survival means seeing things the way they really are and responding. It means being open. And that's what innocence is. It's simple and trusting like a child, not judgmental and committed to one narrow point of view. If you are locked into a pattern of thinking and responding, your creativity gets blocked. You miss the freshness and magic of the moment. Learn to be innocent again, and that freshness never fades.” </p><p> ― This is mostly speculation based on conjectures or some inference from a photograph and if one had to categorize Jackson religiously, it would probably be in some kind of Eastern Zen Buddhism or New Age philosophy. His true spirituality probably came from performing and being an iconic, influential, larger-than-life figure. He once said of performing: …you’re connected to a higher source [when performing] and you just go with the moment and you become one with, you know, the spirit. Not to sound religious or anything, but it’s a very spiritual… very much like religion, and it’s a God-given gift and you just go with it. And I’m honored to have been given it. And, uh, as fun to become one with the audience. It’s a one-ness, you know? Elizabeth Amisu</p><p> The teachings keep getting passed on, teacher to student with the student becoming the teacher for another… ESPN Magazine's Jackie MacMullan on April 13, 2016 wrote "Kobe's final hour: How advice from the King of Pop shaped one of the NBA's most legendary careers:" Flash forward to the summer following his rookie season, and Bryant is lifting weights at Gold's Gym in Venice, California, desperate to chisel his adolescent frame into a man-sized body. He's balancing a barbell on his shoulders when his Nextel cellphone rings mid-squat. He almost lets it go to voicemail, but curiosity wins out. "Hi, it's Michael," the voice on the line says. "Michael who?" "Michael Jackson." Bryant is incredulous. Kobe has never spoken to Michael Jackson before. It doesn't sound like the King of Pop; the voice is lower, subdued, devoid of the childlike whisper Jackson uses onstage. "He's calling me out of the f------ blue," Bryant remembers now. "I don't think it's a real phone call." It is. It turns out Jackson has been studying the young Bryant from afar, and he has called to offer advice, one idiosyncratic phenom to another. "Keep doing what you're doing," Jackson implores him. "Don't come back to the pack and be normal for the sake of blending in with others. Don't dumb it down." The conversation lasts no more than 15 minutes, but the two men click. Jackson clearly knows the NBA, rattling off a string of Lakers factoids. Kobe, a fan of Michael's music, has questions of his own. They come tumbling out: Who were your early influences? How did you make Thriller? What prompted you to buy the catalog of the Beatles' music? When Jackson invites Bryant to join him at Neverland Ranch so the two can trade notes on how they approach their crafts, the 18-year-old Bryant jumps at the chance. The Neverland Ranch, outside Los Olivos, California, is a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Bryant's home in Pacific Palisades through rolling hills and canyons. Bryant misjudges the distance, arriving nearly out of gas. Not to worry, Jackson says, you can fill up at my private gas station. A 2,700-acre cornucopia of childlike delights, Neverland also boasts an amusement park with a Ferris wheel, a roller coaster, a petting zoo housing a llama, orangutans, an elephant and giraffes, and a steam engine named after Michael Jackson's mother, Katherine. Inside the French Normandy residence, the two men share a meal of marinated chicken and organic vegetables. "He told me, 'This is what you love. This is your obsession,'" Bryant recalls. "He said, 'I know what it's like to be different. Embrace it.'" Bryant has never heard of Grace Kelly, Fred Astaire or Ginger Rogers, but during a private film showing of their work, Michael explains how they were the inspiration for Jackson's 1988 "Smooth Criminal" music video and describes the lineage of his music, breaking down songs note by note, taking Bryant through the process of recording "Billie Jean." Jackson tells Kobe that he is transfixed by the success of the Beatles, that he initiated friendships with Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono just to learn more. Your curiosity is your greatest gift, Jackson says. Use it to expand your scope. Ordinary people won't understand your insatiable thirst for excellence. They won't bother to keep striving because it's too onerous, too difficult. "You've got to study all the greats," Jackson tells Kobe. "You've got to learn what made them successful and what made them unsuccessful." </p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><h2 data-reactid="29"><a data-reactid="30">ascribe</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="33"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="34"></div></section></div></div>

When it comes to Jackson’s story today, we’re still doing our best to compartmentalize. We put “Billie Jean” and “Thriller” in one box and put his personal life in another box and try our best not to think about it too much. You have to excavate the human being from the mythology and misinformation built up over the decades. Empathy is the tool required above all others, and empathy is the quality that’s missing from virtually everything ever written about Michael Jackson. We glorify him or we vilify him or we pity him or we take his changing appearance and we use it as fodder for theories about race and gender—the highbrow equivalent of the objectification you’ll find in the tabloids. We do all of this, but we do not attempt to understand him. The idea of Michael Jackson as a human being remains a radical notion. But during the process of writing the book, that is how I came to know him. The eccentric behavior was still eccentric, of course, but seeing it in context, a lot of it actually made sense; I gained a better understanding of why he made the choices he made. As for the allegations of abuse, once I really started digging into them, what surprised me was not just that the allegations are unfounded, but that they are so obviously unfounded. The first claim, made against him in 1993, was debunked by a thorough piece of investigative reporting in GQ. The second claim, made a decade later, was soundly rejected by 12 reasonable jurors as being without merit. These facts are available to anyone with five minutes and an Internet connection. Yet the questions about his innocence persist. The “Wacko Jacko” stories haven’t gone away. The reason they haven’t is because Jackson was different. His actions were outside the norm. People need a context, a framework, in which to understand him. Humans are storytellers. It is our nature to shape facts into a narrative. Jackson’s narrative, driven by the tabloids and adopted by nearly everyone, was that of a boy genius who morphed into a weirdo and a freak and possibly a criminal. That’s the only story we know, and to date no satisfactory counternarrative has emerged to replace it. The allegations against him have long been proved false, but they haven’t been replaced by a more compelling truth. And that’s the problem. Absent a new truth, people remain free to say whatever they want about him. Depending on what day of the week it is, Jackson is either a serial pedophile or a virginal man-child—or, somehow, both. Michael Jackson deserves a more honest accounting of his life. He deserves to have his story told properly. Michael Jackson was, among other things, a smart and voracious reader. He’d take midnight trips to Barnes & Noble and drop $5,000 on books in a single spree. History, art, science, religion, philosophy—he’d sit alone in his house devouring everything he could get his hands on. (If you were a chronic insomniac too famous to leave your own house, you’d read a lot, too.) And the source of Jackson’s Peter Pan obsession was not just Disney’s 1953 animated film, but also J.M. Barrie’s original play and book, vintage editions of which Jackson collected for his library. In Barrie’s original telling, Peter Pan is a very different creature. Unable to grow up, he is trapped in an eternal present. He lives without consequence. He has no memory, and therefore no understanding of how his actions affect others, meaning he can never truly connect or empathize with anyone. He is alone. It’s no accident that Pan’s home, Neverland, is an island cut off from reality. Taken at its most literal, Neverland is a place where you can never land, never rest. It is the same frenetic, make-believe battle of pirates and Indians played out over and over again. When Michael Jackson told us that he was Peter Pan, I don’t think he was telling us that he wanted to be a cartoon. The tragedy of the false allegations against him is that they obscured the very real problems we should have been paying attention to. During his trial, a stream of witnesses testified that Jackson had never done anything inappropriate to them. That they were just friends. I would argue that Jackson’s relationships with children, far from being scandalous, are actually quite boring. Unusual at first glance, yes, but ultimately nothing more than movie nights and trips to amusement parks and other mundane goings-on. Jackson’s relationships with children are more notable for what they tell us about his relationships with adults, or the lack thereof. That’s what’s truly interesting about the man. Jackson bears some responsibility for his own isolation. As a result of a lifetime of being used, he himself was incapable of the kind of reciprocal sharing and trust that meaningful relationships necessarily entail. The man bemoaned his solitude in song after song, yet he was notorious for icing the very relationships he desperately wanted. Jackson could be unfailingly kind and generous to people, but that ostensible sweetness masked a deeper inability to relate. He’d grown up as the center of his own universe, in a world where everyone catered to him. When relationships grew messy or demanding, he would just shut them down. By the time he moved to Vegas, Jackson had distanced himself from all of his famous siblings. (Yes, even Janet.) Jackson’s two marriages, to Lisa Marie Presley and Debbie Rowe, are also good examples. Like everything else in Jackson’s life, those relationships were the subject of endless and generally tasteless speculation. But we needn’t speculate about the nature of the marriages to note the one obvious thing about them: They didn’t last very long. Even if they were the arrangements people alleged them to be, they weren’t even successful on that level. Maybe the guy on TV calling himself Peter Pan wasn’t the crazy one. Jackson took refuge in the world of children because it was the only place he felt safe. Children, he often said, “don’t want anything from you.” In fact, outside of the recording studio, only three relationships served as constants in Jackson’s world: his relationship with his mother, his relationship with his fans, and his relationship with children. These relationships all share one thing in common: They’re easy. A mother’s love is unconditional. The devotion of a fan, even more so. And who among us is immune to the wide-eyed adoration of a child? These types of love, though a joy to receive, require little effort. They don’t challenge the recipient. And eventually, they become debilitating. Too much mothering and too much hero-worship stranded Jackson right where he was, left him unwilling and unable to change. It’s admirable that Jackson’s hard-core fans never rushed to judge him the way the general public did, but the adoration of fans and children alone cannot fill the role of a spouse or a partner or true friend. Those are the relationships that force us to be our best selves. Ecstasies innumerable, yet denied the simple joys of being human. Seems a pretty astute description of life inside Jackson’s gilded cage. Maybe the guy on TV calling himself Peter Pan wasn’t the crazy one. The biggest difference I can see between Michael Jackson and Peter Pan was that Pan had no memory of what caused the nightmares that afflicted him. Jackson knew all too well why he couldn’t sleep at night, which is why he looked to the syringe and the pill bottle to try and make it to morning. Michael Jackson made a lot of unhealthy choices in an effort to cope with the burdens he carried, but we shouldn’t judge those choices without a diligent and sincere effort to understand why he made them. Last year the late King of Pop topped Forbes’ list of highest-earning celebrities, easily besting his closest living competitor, Madonna, by a good $35 million. That feat was made possible by a massive overhaul of his debt-ridden estate, which has been transformed into a wildly profitable, billion-dollar enterprise. If that much effort can be made to refurbish his professional legacy, it would be a crime if we did any less for his personal one. Michael Jackson ought to have his story reconsidered. The man led an extraordinary and extraordinarily difficult life. He deserves an epitaph that doesn’t have an asterisk next to it.","_html":"<p> We all remember where we were … when we got the news that Michael Jackson had died, killed by a fatal dose of some obscure hospital-grade anesthetic the singer used to cope with his chronic insomnia.

We glorify him or we vilify him or we pity him or we take his changing appearance and we use it as fodder for theories about race and gender—the highbrow equivalent of the objectification you’ll find in the tabloids. We do all of this, but we do not attempt to understand him. The idea of Michael Jackson as a human being remains a radical notion. But during the process of writing the book, that is how I came to know him. The eccentric behavior was still eccentric, of course, but seeing it in context, a lot of it actually made sense; I gained a better understanding of why he made the choices he made. As for the allegations of abuse, once I really started digging into them, what surprised me was not just that the allegations are unfounded, but that they are so obviously unfounded. The first claim, made against him in 1993, was debunked by a thorough piece of investigative reporting in GQ. The second claim, made a decade later, was soundly rejected by 12 reasonable jurors as being without merit. These facts are available to anyone with five minutes and an Internet connection. Yet the questions about his innocence persist. The “Wacko Jacko” stories haven’t gone away. The reason they haven’t is because Jackson was different. His actions were outside the norm. People need a context, a framework, in which to understand him. Humans are storytellers. It is our nature to shape facts into a narrative. Jackson’s narrative, driven by the tabloids and adopted by nearly everyone, was that of a boy genius who morphed into a weirdo and a freak and possibly a criminal. That’s the only story we know, and to date no satisfactory counternarrative has emerged to replace it. The allegations against him have long been proved false, but they haven’t been replaced by a more compelling truth. And that’s the problem. Absent a new truth, people remain free to say whatever they want about him. Depending on what day of the week it is, Jackson is either a serial pedophile or a virginal man-child—or, somehow, both. Michael Jackson deserves a more honest accounting of his life. He deserves to have his story told properly. Michael Jackson was, among other things, a smart and voracious reader. He’d take midnight trips to Barnes & Noble and drop $5,000 on books in a single spree. History, art, science, religion, philosophy—he’d sit alone in his house devouring everything he could get his hands on. (If you were a chronic insomniac too famous to leave your own house, you’d read a lot, too.) And the source of Jackson’s Peter Pan obsession was not just Disney’s 1953 animated film, but also J.M. Barrie’s original play and book, vintage editions of which Jackson collected for his library. In Barrie’s original telling, Peter Pan is a very different creature. Unable to grow up, he is trapped in an eternal present. He lives without consequence. He has no memory, and therefore no understanding of how his actions affect others, meaning he can never truly connect or empathize with anyone. He is alone. It’s no accident that Pan’s home, Neverland, is an island cut off from reality. Taken at its most literal, Neverland is a place where you can never land, never rest. It is the same frenetic, make-believe battle of pirates and Indians played out over and over again. When Michael Jackson told us that he was Peter Pan, I don’t think he was telling us that he wanted to be a cartoon. The tragedy of the false allegations against him is that they obscured the very real problems we should have been paying attention to. During his trial, a stream of witnesses testified that Jackson had never done anything inappropriate to them. That they were just friends. I would argue that Jackson’s relationships with children, far from being scandalous, are actually quite boring. Unusual at first glance, yes, but ultimately nothing more than movie nights and trips to amusement parks and other mundane goings-on. Jackson’s relationships with children are more notable for what they tell us about his relationships with adults, or the lack thereof. That’s what’s truly interesting about the man. Jackson bears some responsibility for his own isolation. As a result of a lifetime of being used, he himself was incapable of the kind of reciprocal sharing and trust that meaningful relationships necessarily entail. The man bemoaned his solitude in song after song, yet he was notorious for icing the very relationships he desperately wanted. Jackson could be unfailingly kind and generous to people, but that ostensible sweetness masked a deeper inability to relate. He’d grown up as the center of his own universe, in a world where everyone catered to him. When relationships grew messy or demanding, he would just shut them down. By the time he moved to Vegas, Jackson had distanced himself from all of his famous siblings. (Yes, even Janet.) Jackson’s two marriages, to Lisa Marie Presley and Debbie Rowe, are also good examples. Like everything else in Jackson’s life, those relationships were the subject of endless and generally tasteless speculation. But we needn’t speculate about the nature of the marriages to note the one obvious thing about them: They didn’t last very long. Even if they were the arrangements people alleged them to be, they weren’t even successful on that level. Maybe the guy on TV calling himself Peter Pan wasn’t the crazy one. Jackson took refuge in the world of children because it was the only place he felt safe. Children, he often said, “don’t want anything from you.” In fact, outside of the recording studio, only three relationships served as constants in Jackson’s world: his relationship with his mother, his relationship with his fans, and his relationship with children. These relationships all share one thing in common: They’re easy. A mother’s love is unconditional. The devotion of a fan, even more so. And who among us is immune to the wide-eyed adoration of a child? These types of love, though a joy to receive, require little effort. They don’t challenge the recipient. And eventually, they become debilitating. Too much mothering and too much hero-worship stranded Jackson right where he was, left him unwilling and unable to change. It’s admirable that Jackson’s hard-core fans never rushed to judge him the way the general public did, but the adoration of fans and children alone cannot fill the role of a spouse or a partner or true friend. Those are the relationships that force us to be our best selves. Ecstasies innumerable, yet denied the simple joys of being human. Seems a pretty astute description of life inside Jackson’s gilded cage. Maybe the guy on TV calling himself Peter Pan wasn’t the crazy one. The biggest difference I can see between Michael Jackson and Peter Pan was that Pan had no memory of what caused the nightmares that afflicted him. Jackson knew all too well why he couldn’t sleep at night, which is why he looked to the syringe and the pill bottle to try and make it to morning. Michael Jackson made a lot of unhealthy choices in an effort to cope with the burdens he carried, but we shouldn’t judge those choices without a diligent and sincere effort to understand why he made them. Last year the late King of Pop topped Forbes’ list of highest-earning celebrities, easily besting his closest living competitor, Madonna, by a good $35 million. That feat was made possible by a massive overhaul of his debt-ridden estate, which has been transformed into a wildly profitable, billion-dollar enterprise. If that much effort can be made to refurbish his professional legacy, it would be a crime if we did any less for his personal one. Michael Jackson ought to have his story reconsidered. The man led an extraordinary and extraordinarily difficult life. He deserves an epitaph that doesn’t have an asterisk next to it.</p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"cf064678-4485-42f3-8b48-4b4a04bdeb87","item":"eef22a06-188f-4379-978a-c93c413834a7","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":" Neither was stranger to criticism and comparisons: Blavatsky's Prophecy and Krishnamurti Jun 20, 1996 02:54 PM by alexis dolgorukii: A message with this title has appeared both on \"theos-list\" and \"alt.theosophy\" several times lately so I would assume everyone who is interested in the subject has read it and I shan't re-print it.

The vow of chastity is not chastity at all, for below the words the cravings goes on and trying to suppress it in different ways, religion and otherwise, is a form of ugliness which, in its very essence, is unchaste. The chastity of the monk, with his vows and denials, is essentially worldliness which is unchaste. All forms of resistance build a wall of separation which turns life into a battlefield; and so life becomes not chaste at all. To deny sex is another form of brutality; it is there, it is a fact. When we are intellectual slaves, endlessly repeating what others have said, when we are following, obeying, imitating, then a whole avenue of life is closed; when action is merely mechanical repetition and not a free movement, then there is no release; when there is an incessant urge to fulfill, to be, then we are emotionally thwarted, there is a blockage. So sex becomes the one issue which is our very own, which is not second-hand. And in the act of sex there is a forgetting of oneself , one's problems and one's fears. In that act there is no self at all. - Can't you fall in love and not have a possessive relationship? I love someone and she loves me, and we get married -- that is all perfectly straightforward and simple, in that here is no conflict at all. Can't one have that without the other? Without the tail, as it were, necessarily following? Can two people be in love and both be so intelligent and so sensitive that there is freedom and an absence of a centre that makes conflict? Conflict is not in the feeling of being in love. The feeling of being in love is utterly without conflict. Three is no loss of energy in being in love. The loss of energy is in the tail -- jealousy, possessiveness, suspicion, doubt, the fear of losing that love, the constant demand for reassurance and security. Surely it must be possible to function in a sexual relationship with someone you love without the nightmare which usually follows. Of course it is. - You have to find out for yourself. Sex plays an extraordinary important part in our lives because it is perhaps the only deep, first-hand experience we have. Intellectually and emotionally we conform, imitate, follow, obey. There is pain and strife in all our relationships, except in the act of sex. This act, being so different and beautiful, we become addicted to, so it in turns become bondage. The bondage is the demand for its continuation -- again the action of the centre which is divisive. One is so hedged about -- intellectually, in the family, in the community, through social morality, through religious sanctions -- so hedged about that there is only this one relationship left in which there is freedom and intensity. Therefore we give tremendous importance to it. But if there were freedom all around then this would not be such a craving and such a problem. We make it a problem because we can't get enough of it; or because we feel guilty at having got it, or because in getting it we break the rules which society had laid down. It is the old society which calls the new society permissive because for the new society sex is a part of life. In freeing the mind from the bondage of imitation, authority, conformity and religious prescriptions, sex has its own place, but it won't be all-consuming. From this one can see that freedom is essential for love -- not the freedom of revolt, not the freedom of doing what none likes or not indulging openly or secretly one's cravings, but rather the freedom which comes in the understanding of this whole structure and nature of the centre. The freedom is love. \"I'm sorry you feel that way about what I say. The ecstasy that I feel is the outcome of this world. I wanted to understand, I wanted to conquer sorrow, this pain and detachment, and attachment, death, continuity of life, everything that man goes through every day. I wanted to understand, I wanted to conquer sorrow, this pain of detachment & attachment, death, continuity of life, everything that man goes through every day. I want to understand and conquer it. I have. So my ecstasy is real & infinite, not an escape. I know that way out of this incessant misery, and I want to help people out of the bog of this sorrow.

So sex becomes the one issue which is our very own, which is not second-hand. And in the act of sex there is a forgetting of oneself , one's problems and one's fears. In that act there is no self at all. - Can't you fall in love and not have a possessive relationship? I love someone and she loves me, and we get married -- that is all perfectly straightforward and simple, in that here is no conflict at all. Can't one have that without the other? Without the tail, as it were, necessarily following? Can two people be in love and both be so intelligent and so sensitive that there is freedom and an absence of a centre that makes conflict? Conflict is not in the feeling of being in love. The feeling of being in love is utterly without conflict. Three is no loss of energy in being in love. The loss of energy is in the tail -- jealousy, possessiveness, suspicion, doubt, the fear of losing that love, the constant demand for reassurance and security. Surely it must be possible to function in a sexual relationship with someone you love without the nightmare which usually follows. Of course it is. - You have to find out for yourself. Sex plays an extraordinary important part in our lives because it is perhaps the only deep, first-hand experience we have. Intellectually and emotionally we conform, imitate, follow, obey. There is pain and strife in all our relationships, except in the act of sex. This act, being so different and beautiful, we become addicted to, so it in turns become bondage. The bondage is the demand for its continuation -- again the action of the centre which is divisive. One is so hedged about -- intellectually, in the family, in the community, through social morality, through religious sanctions -- so hedged about that there is only this one relationship left in which there is freedom and intensity. Therefore we give tremendous importance to it. But if there were freedom all around then this would not be such a craving and such a problem. We make it a problem because we can't get enough of it; or because we feel guilty at having got it, or because in getting it we break the rules which society had laid down. It is the old society which calls the new society permissive because for the new society sex is a part of life. In freeing the mind from the bondage of imitation, authority, conformity and religious prescriptions, sex has its own place, but it won't be all-consuming. From this one can see that freedom is essential for love -- not the freedom of revolt, not the freedom of doing what none likes or not indulging openly or secretly one's cravings, but rather the freedom which comes in the understanding of this whole structure and nature of the centre. The freedom is love. \"I'm sorry you feel that way about what I say. The ecstasy that I feel is the outcome of this world. I wanted to understand, I wanted to conquer sorrow, this pain and detachment, and attachment, death, continuity of life, everything that man goes through every day. I wanted to understand, I wanted to conquer sorrow, this pain of detachment & attachment, death, continuity of life, everything that man goes through every day. I want to understand and conquer it. I have. So my ecstasy is real & infinite, not an escape. I know that way out of this incessant misery, and I want to help people out of the bog of this sorrow.

From the beginning it was always a quandary for me, Michael’s birthday. From the first day we met, unfamiliar to me, I was faced with his chosen religion, Jehovah’s Witness. When Michael arrived for his photo shoot for THRILLER, two men accompanied him impeccably dressed in suits, who sat over to the side on some cushy couches and watched his every move. Since this was the first time I worked with him, it didn’t feel appropriate for me to ask who they could possibly be. I thought if he wanted us to know, he would have told us. I just felt their presence throughout the entire day. They left with him as mysteriously as they had entered with him. At the time I really did not give it another thought, because I had no idea of the adventure that was ahead of me. The next shoot, there again…a mysterious gentleman, sitting in the background. As our working relationship and friendship began to grow, I asked. He explained to me he was a Jehovah’s Witness. He was very active with the church, and these gentlemen were monitors. They watched over him. He also explained he went to bible study, and spent time going door-to-door teaching the word each week. I had to take pause for a minute and think about that one…. THRILLER had been released by the time he was explaining this to me. “You mean to tell me, that you ring someone’s doorbell, they come to answer it, and there stands Michael Jackson??????” He gave me one of his hi pitched belly laughs…and said, “yeah”. He further explained that he does it in disguise. “Oh no you don’t.” Still giggling, he paused and got amusingly serious. “Yeah, sure. After they let me in, they usually begin to look at me funny, so I end up admitting who I am.” “Wow, I wish I could be a fly on the wall and watch that. I still can’t believe you do that.” I said. “It is a big part of being a Jehovah’s Witness. We also do not celebrate holidays or birthdays. We believe that we should honor and celebrate these things daily, and not have just one day.” So I asked “No birthdays. No Christmas?” “No” he replied. “Isn’t that difficult, when the world around you is decorating and singing carols?”. “Yes, Turkle…it is always kind of sad, especially when I was a child, because it looked like so much fun. But it is okay; we have things like FAMILY DAY, where we all get together. There are hundreds of Jacksons and we all try and be there.” I could genuinely see the sadness in his eyes and the sense his feeling of loss, not celebrating Christmas with the other kids…so I changed the subject. One August 29th, we ended up working. Everyone was wishing him Happy Birthday and giving him little presents. He smiled and graciously accepted them. Once we were in the privacy of the trailer, he put the gifts down on the seat, and looked down at them. “I wish people wouldn’t do that. Please promise me, Turkle, don’t EVER say Happy Birthday to me.” I was torn. I once again saw how sad and conflicted he was on the inside about this, but he remained loyal to hi s beliefs. It was so difficult for me too. I wanted to give him a present and a big birthday hug every time August 29th rolled around, and join in with the others who were celebrating his birthday around him. I also wanted to comply with his request not to even SAY happy birthday. We were shooting SMOOTH CRIMINAL. I was accustomed to the monitors by now. The filming was going on longer than planned, as usual. We were preparing for a very big scene. Michael was surrounded by the alien battalion in a gully, built on stage 14. The special weapons and ammunition team had briefed Michael on how to hold the machine gun and fire it. It was the last scene of the evening. Michael was having fun with it, like a little boy playing army. He took a strong stance, and fired as the cameras rolled. That was a wrap for that evening, and we were given our call time for the next morning. Michael was a little late arriving the next day. I was waiting in his trailer. He walked in so distraught. I didn’t understand, we were having so much fun the night before. He was silent as he sat in the makeup chair. I had to ask him please tell me. Please tell me what is wrong. His eyes welled up with tears. “Mother called last night. The church called her, and told her that I held and fired a gun yesterday. They ordered that I have to make decision. I must leave the church, or leave the entertainment industry.” He was weeping as he uttered those words. I was quite mortified. “What did your mother advise you to do?” “She felt horrible. She told me it was up to me. She said she would stand by me with whatever I decided.” “I see, you are here today”. “Yes” “Mother is supporting my choice”. -- Karen Faye, make-up artist and friend","_html":"<p> “When all life is seen as divine, everyone grows wings.” Michael Jackson Like Krishnamurti, Jackson felt the pressures and pulls of organized religion were incongruent with his spiritual consciousness and broke from them.

Those people understand love, not as a feeling, but as a state of being, a way of relating to the world. They have a certain light about them; a way of living that encompasses being kind, caring, compassionate and empathic. Through their ability to connect to love, they have the potential to heal the world. Michael Jackson was one of them. In an attempt to define love, I’ll defer to Marianne Williamson through her book called \"A Return to Love.\" She says, \"(Love) is our ultimate reality, and our purpose on earth. To be consciously aware of it, to experience love in ourselves and others, is the meaning of life.\" Michael seemed to truly understand that concept. His connection to love was so strong that he had an enhanced ability to deeply touch other people with his light. When someone who is that connected to love focuses their attention on you in a positive way, the result is a flow of energy that penetrates your soul and the outcome is a feeling of pure joy. Once that joyful feeling is experienced you want more, so you’re continually drawn back to the source of it, which in the case is Michael. Lisa Marie Presley touched on it in her recent interview with Oprah Winfrey. When she was asked why she fell in love with Michael, she said, \"because he was an incredibly dynamic person. If you were in his vicinity and he showed you who he was, if he was willing to do that, in any way, man I’ve never felt so high in my life. He had something so intoxicating about him.\" Fans know that feeling all too well. We were always the focus of his attention in a positive way, but it was good to hear that those who were close to him felt the same effect. Oprah even let on to the fact that she was taken in by it, \"When I first met him before the interview in 1992,\" Oprah said, \"it’s like he shines his light upon you. When he opens himself up and lets that light through, you just want to be in that, you want to be around that.\" Lisa Marie went on to describe him as her drug. \"I felt like I just always wanted to be around him. I always wanted to be part of it. I felt so high. I’ve never felt that way around another human being except for one…which is my father.\" Michael’s light, which affected millions all over the world, was so powerful that even in death it keeps pulling people back in. It’s been over a year and a half since his passing and the world can’t seem to let him go. (...) Once you have been on the receiving end of his light, it’s hard to let him go. You’re drawn to him forever, because it was through him that you experienced the power of love. (...)\" Linda Higgins, 2010","_html":"<p> \"In every generation, there are a handful of people who come into this world equipped with the ability to change it for the better because of their heightened sense of awareness about the power of love. Those people understand love, not as a feeling, but as a state of being, a way of relating to the world. They have a certain light about them; a way of living that encompasses being kind, caring, compassionate and empathic. Through their ability to connect to love, they have the potential to heal the world. Michael Jackson was one of them. In an attempt to define love, I’ll defer to Marianne Williamson through her book called \"A Return to Love.\" She says, \"(Love) is our ultimate reality, and our purpose on earth. To be consciously aware of it, to experience love in ourselves and others, is the meaning of life.\" Michael seemed to truly understand that concept. His connection to love was so strong that he had an enhanced ability to deeply touch other people with his light. When someone who is that connected to love focuses their attention on you in a positive way, the result is a flow of energy that penetrates your soul and the outcome is a feeling of pure joy. Once that joyful feeling is experienced you want more, so you’re continually drawn back to the source of it, which in the case is Michael. Lisa Marie Presley touched on it in her recent interview with Oprah Winfrey. When she was asked why she fell in love with Michael, she said, \"because he was an incredibly dynamic person. If you were in his vicinity and he showed you who he was, if he was willing to do that, in any way, man I’ve never felt so high in my life. He had something so intoxicating about him.\" Fans know that feeling all too well. We were always the focus of his attention in a positive way, but it was good to hear that those who were close to him felt the same effect. Oprah even let on to the fact that she was taken in by it, \"When I first met him before the interview in 1992,\" Oprah said, \"it’s like he shines his light upon you. When he opens himself up and lets that light through, you just want to be in that, you want to be around that.\" Lisa Marie went on to describe him as her drug. \"I felt like I just always wanted to be around him. I always wanted to be part of it. I felt so high. I’ve never felt that way around another human being except for one…which is my father.\" Michael’s light, which affected millions all over the world, was so powerful that even in death it keeps pulling people back in.

I felt something!” And I would hear that over and over again and I would say, “I know, I know. I’ve been feeling it for thirty years.” And he was just so pleasant; just something with his imagery. Everybody radiates from a different frequency, and Michael had the highest level of energy I think without being from another world. His gift and his humanity of spirit were just so powerful and great and deep. He was a different human being from most of us; from all of us. He did affect everybody that came around him, from leaders of the world to normal folk, from children to people, grandmothers. Every single person that’s been around him said they felt something, that I remember seeing or talking to. And that’s why people cry. People absolutely cry. I would sit on stage and watch them pass bodies, like back in the medieval days when people died of the plague. You would see them lift bodies, arms dangling and legs, heads swinging, and there was like an ocean of people with their arms up passing bodies to the front, to the gate. There would be a line-up there of emergency vehicles... five, ten of them lined up. There were stretchers and triages back there. One by one, people were passing them forward; sometimes a multitude of bodies moving across the crowd being passed to the rescue people. They would give them smelling salts and try to revive them. Some people were just totally gone, unconscious, you know, like totally no life in them, and that’s just from being in that stadium with Michael. I just got to just sit back there and marvel at it. It was just the most powerful thing to see, and that’s just from that one man in the center of the stage. He made even men pass out; women and men. That’s a power and Michael knew it.

Standing elbow to elbow and shoulder to shoulder with him, you could feel him discovering things in the brush and inkstrokes that even the artist never saw.

I’ve worked with Prince, Bob Marley, Peter Gabriel, Billy Joel, and Bette Midler, some of the most talented people of our generation, and not one of them had the quality of wonder that came alive in Michael. He saw the wonder in everything. His quality of wonder was beyond anything most of us humans can conceive. Look, above all other things I’m a scientist. Science is my religion. It’s been my religion since I was ten years old.

He believed he was given a gift by God. He believed he was given talents and wonders and astonishments seldom granted to us very fragile human beings. Because God had given him this enormous gift, he felt he owed the experience of wonder, astonishment, awe, and Blake’s infinities to his fellow human beings. But unlike other generous humans–Bill and Melinda Gates, for example–with Michael giving to others was not just a part-time thing. The need to give to others was alive in every breath he took every single day. Michael Jackson’s entire life was receiving and giving and the whole purpose of receiving was so he could give. He worked with every cell in his body to give the gift of that amazement, that astonishment to his fellow human beings. Needing the adulation of crowds WAS Michael’s connection to others, his most profound connection, far more profound than family and friends (though those are indispensable), and far more healing.

Don't dumb it down.\" The conversation lasts no more than 15 minutes, but the two men click. Jackson clearly knows the NBA, rattling off a string of Lakers factoids.

Bryant misjudges the distance, arriving nearly out of gas. Not to worry, Jackson says, you can fill up at my private gas station. A 2,700-acre cornucopia of childlike delights, Neverland also boasts an amusement park with a Ferris wheel, a roller coaster, a petting zoo housing a llama, orangutans, an elephant and giraffes, and a steam engine named after Michael Jackson's mother, Katherine. Inside the French Normandy residence, the two men share a meal of marinated chicken and organic vegetables. \"He told me, 'This is what you love. This is your obsession,'\" Bryant recalls. \"He said, 'I know what it's like to be different. Embrace it.'\" Bryant has never heard of Grace Kelly, Fred Astaire or Ginger Rogers, but during a private film showing of their work, Michael explains how they were the inspiration for Jackson's 1988 \"Smooth Criminal\" music video and describes the lineage of his music, breaking down songs note by note, taking Bryant through the process of recording \"Billie Jean.\" Jackson tells Kobe that he is transfixed by the success of the Beatles, that he initiated friendships with Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono just to learn more. Your curiosity is your greatest gift, Jackson says. Use it to expand your scope. Ordinary people won't understand your insatiable thirst for excellence.
