That until the color of a man&#x27;s skin is of no more significance than the color of his eyes; That until the basic human rights are equally guaranteed to all without regard to race; That until that day, the dream of lasting peace and world citizenship and the rule of international morality will remain but a fleeting illusion, to be pursued but never attained; …Until bigotry and prejudice and malicious and inhuman self-interest have been replaced by understanding and tolerance and good-will; Until all Africans stand and speak as free beings, equal in the eyes of all men, as they are in the eyes of Heaven; Until that day, the African continent will not know peace. We Africans will fight, if necessary, and we know that we shall win, as we are confident in the victory of good over evil. (In his musical rendition of speech excerpts, Bob Marley would add: War in the east /War in the west /War up north/War down south/War/War/Rumors of war/Everywhere is war.) …And we must look into ourselves, into the depth of our souls. We must become something we have never been and for which our education and experience and environment have ill-prepared us. We must become bigger than we have been -- more courageous, greater in spirit, larger in outlook. We must become members of a new race, overcoming petty prejudice, owing our ultimate allegiance not to nations but to our fellow men within the human community .- Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie before the United Nations in October 1963</p></div></div></div></section><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="57"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1 " data-reactid="58"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="59"><!-- react-empty: 60 --><!-- react-empty: 61 --><!-- react-empty: 62 --><!-- react-empty: 63 --><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="64"><p data-reactid="65">Sunday I was invited to a French-English service at a Kingdom Hall just outside Papeete, so I went. It was an opportunity to further study French as the speaker was translated after each sentence or paragraph; and there were certain to be cute, spiritual-seeking women.  I had attended a similar service in a regional setting during October, and knew what to expect and did not go seeking enlightenment. The theme of the day was how parents should interact or deal with their teen-age children. Humility, insight and explanation were the essential elements, with parents being willing to admit their mistakes, inject biblical teachings in conversations with the teen, and give explanations when directing him or her to do this and not do that. Nothing new, and everything conveyed was supported by a verse from the Bible. I began to feel that the session and church in general was stuck in history -- the past. Speakers noted, of course, that teens face peer and societal pressures today like never before. Yet, they relied on the Bible and standardized church text that lacked a real-world, contemporary message. And, unfortunately there were no teens -- only adults and several pre-teens -- at the gathering. Whenever I am in a church setting, listening to a lecture or sermon, the speaker touches on a theme and then God/The Universe begins transmitting to me on that subject just what needs to be said and heard.(Dialogues in New York City by Krishnamurti way back in the 1980s were the only occasion the message was enlightening and needed no personal or divine intervention.) The speaker, inevitably, does not go there although a few approach the precipice. They are just unwilling to step out on faith and go beyond the Bible or religious dogma. Churches across the board are stuck in time, and listless, primarily because they relegate God, or the Supreme Being, to a mere book. A book that even a cursory look at history will show is very flawed, compiled by figures of ill repute and cannot actually be &quot;the word of God.&quot; The church would have you believe God cannot speak for him/her/itself - as if God is dead and in dying left behind a book and said, &quot;Hear, read this.&quot; The biblical image of a shepherd and sheep is illustrative of how churches see the world. It is said God had an :only begotten son&quot; Jesus, and that he came to earth to be an example of what we, who also are called children of God, should.be Jesus is said to have said, &quot;Whatever I do, you can do, and more.&quot; The church minimizes such expressions and instead treat truth-seekers as sheep with it as the shepherd and the Bible its staff to keep us in line and essentially docile. I felt pacification in the air, as every issue was referred to the Bible with the effective message being pray and believe, be a &quot;good&quot; individual and wait on God. And I was reminded of Sunday School, although this was an adult setting -- as speakers asked elementary questions and  listeners gave formulaic answers. I left the setting occasionally to re-enter the real world -- to Aleepo, centre-ville Papeete and the streets of North America, Europe, Africa and Asia.. I thought , &quot;Now, I would actually join a church that does more than merely instruct how we should behave in our individual petty lives or as families without  directly addressing the lives and families living in the strife or war, poverty (just down the street) and natural disasters the world over. The thought came why cannot churches, instead of using tithing to build idolisict edifices, charter a plane to Damascus and go to the frontlines and illustrate the abomination of war and as human shields stopping it in its tracks. If only a fraction of the churches, the mosques, the temples that exist do this, the war would end immediately. We could force the state and rebel forces to stop destroying Syria, and the United States, Russia, France and the United Kingdom from decimating it with bombs, spawning countless refugees. With such coordinated mass action, religious institutions could force governments to finally confront and eliminate poverty. They could effect more humane governmental and corporate practices to end wealth inequality and the fascism gripping the world as the distinction between to two arenas has been erased.  As it is the church, religious institutions are the greatest purveyor of the status quo.  Nothing has changed in the centuries since Europe demonstrated it could dominate the world through the bible, the bottle and the gun.   </p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="5" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="66"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="67"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="68"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="69"><span data-reactid="70"><!-- react-empty: 71 --><h2 data-reactid="72"><a data-reactid="73">ascribe</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="74"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="75"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="76"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="77"></div></section></div></div>
